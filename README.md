# Display Indicator

A simple indicator (stolen shamelessly from https://askubuntu.com/a/854454) to choose my display configuration

Uses a material design icon from https://material.io/resources/icons/

## Usage

Edit the `commands` file and put the title, followed by "||", then the command you would like to run.

In my example, I have 3 options in the indicator, each to control the monitor layout.

Note: The material design icon I have included is licensed under the Apache license version 2.0.
